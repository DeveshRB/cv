# My first website build completely on HTMLðŸ”¥




### I am writing this README in 2021, 3 months after I started learning web development and I'm so glad that I choose to learn Web Development.ðŸ™Œ

**This journey has been so great so far. After this project I started learning CSS, then Bootstrap, then Javascript, then React, then Node, and then Databases. My skills have definately enhanced since my first website but I still love this website and it will always be close to my heart.â™¥**

**I am writing this README for myself and I'll keep updating it every year and cherish my achievement every year!ðŸš€**
